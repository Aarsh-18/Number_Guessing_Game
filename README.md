There are two python files here. One is named as 'Number Guessing Game-computer.py' and 'Number Guessing Game-user.py'
In the fist file, computer generates a random number with the given user-input's
lower and upper bound (the range in which the number lies). The user tries to guess the number and is allowed a certain number of attempts.
If the user guessses correctly, it prints that the user guessed it else it prints better luck next time an prints the number.

In the second, the user thinks of a random number and gives the computer the upper and lower bound. The computer tries to guess it and user provides the appropriate
feedback whether the number is less/high or correct. If the computer guesses it within the maximum attempts, it wins else computer loses.

Both the files are meant for beginners to learn python and develop coding skills.
